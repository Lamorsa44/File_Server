# File Server
## About
Two main programs one being the Client and the Server,
Each creates new folders where to hold and manipulate files.

### GET

To retrieve a file from the server the file must exist in the server and then it would get written to the folder of the client

To post a file the client must have a file and it would be written unless there is a file with the same name in the server
